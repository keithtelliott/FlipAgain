<h1>FlipAgain</h1>
<p>A flashcard app!</p>  
<p>
In development, that is... I am shooting for going live with my initial release on <b>March 15, 2021</b>... 
</p>
<p>
...So it is March 15, 2021, as I write this, and I'm a bit delayed.  I need a few days to 
get my MVP (minimum viable product) out the door.  And even then, I'll emphasize the 'minimum' 
in MVP  :)  
</p>
<p>
I'm delayed, in part, because I've been 
capturing my development journey on YouTube.  I encourage you to check out the  
<a href="https://youtu.be/Q4BnWK05H5w">first</a> of many videos!
</p>
<p>NO seat belt needed, 
because it is <i>slow coding with Keith</i>.  Many more videos will follow, as I progress my simple app 
idea into a valuable tool for learning.  I hope you join my journey!
